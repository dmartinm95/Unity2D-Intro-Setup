  storyText: 'In front of you is the expanse of the airship hangar.


    Festers
    are running everywhere and mostly yelling at one another. Some men are clambering
    aboard airships, others are attempting to put out fires that have started from
    the explosion.


    Who were those men? Friend or foe? That will have to wait.
    Time to get out of here.


    What now?

    1. Mad sprint to the nearest airship.

    2.
    Quick scrounge for weapons, then mad sprint to the nearest airship.'
